# Airline Food Demand Prediction System

**Team Name:** Vector_Team

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting airline food demand. It features a consolidated workflow including synthetic data generation with realistic noise, exploratory data analysis, and multiple optimized regression models.

## Key Features
- **Consolidated Workflow:** All steps from data generation to evaluation in a single Jupyter Notebook.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Includes Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` for tree-based models.
- **Business Impact:** Financial cost analysis of prediction errors.
- **Realism:** Synthetic data includes 5% random noise to simulate real-world uncertainty.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the synthetic dataset (`Vector_Team_dataset.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: The main project notebook (`Vector_Team_Final_Project.ipynb`).
- `reports/`: Final project report in PDF and Markdown formats.
- `src/`: Python scripts used for data generation and processing.
- `plots/`: Visualizations generated during the analysis.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nbformat`
2. Open `notebooks/Vector_Team_Final_Project.ipynb` to view the full implementation.
