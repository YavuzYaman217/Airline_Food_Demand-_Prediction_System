# Airline Food Demand Prediction System

**Team Name:** Vector_Team

## Project Overview
This project provides a machine learning solution for predicting airline food demand based on flight characteristics and passenger demographics. It includes synthetic data generation, exploratory data analysis, and regression modeling.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the synthetic dataset (`Vector_Team_dataset.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and Modeling.
- `reports/`: Final project report in PDF and Markdown formats.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data generation, EDA, and modeling.
- `plots/`: Visualizations generated during analysis.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nbformat`
2. Generate data: `python src/data_generation.py`
3. Run analysis: Open notebooks in `notebooks/` or run scripts in `src/`.

## Validation
The dataset satisfies all 9 critical validation rules specified in the project requirements.
